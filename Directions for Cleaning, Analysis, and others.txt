Direction - these individual project have cleaning/ analysibg and exploratory directions that we can learn from.

Cleaning

- I like this guy cleaning too. Looks really simple and not over analysis.
Hope to strike a balance between data understanding and succint data analysis.

ML model performance comparison

<this guy is pretty useless bc hes doing international data but we come use some feature>

To add to limitations:
- Data set from insideairbnb
- XGBoost model only address non-spatial variables not spatial dependence variable : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666827021001043
- Lack of domain expertise


Do statistical analysis on : Impact of Airbnb images on Airbnb prices
- Motivation: https://higherbookings.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/How-Much-is-an-Image-Worth-Airbnb-Property-Demand-Analytics-Leveraging-A-Scalable-Image-Classification-Algorithm.pdf
- https://github.com/deepak-karkala/airbnb-data-science/blob/master/notebooks/rank_listings_by_image_aesthetics.ipynb
Get aesthetics score and segment 100 high priced airbnb vs 100 low priced airbnb (set a price cut off to be the 3rd quadrant and 1st quadrant, the 2nd quadrant is the median). 
Do a ttest on those two group, in order to reject H0.
If H0 is rejected (which hopefully it is), it means that aestheticness of listing explains the price.
